## 3.5 Tense

Present and Past Tense


* both used at varying degrees in all manuscript sections

|    | Introduction   | Methods   | Results  |  Disussion   | 
| :-----: | :-----: |:-----: |:-----: |:-----: |
| Present tense | high | -  | low  | high  | 
| Pase Tense| mid | high  |  high | mid  | 

### Introduction: mix of tenses(Present tense HIGH, Past tense Mid)

* present tense to describe connonly accepted theories

* past tense to describe the work of others

* Examples-1:One of the main arguments against retulation **was** the lack of evidence proving its environmental persistence and long-range transport(past tense).

* Examples-2: In additioin, dicofol **is listed** as a persistent toxic substance in a series of multilateral agreements.(present tense)

### Methods Section: Past tense HIGH

* past tense, usually used toghther with passive voice, to describe the process of experimental procedures

* Examples: Binding assays **were performed** as described previously.

### Result Section: Past Tense HIGH, Present Tense variable

* past tense to describe your own results

* exception: crystal structure papers

* present tense for concouding assessment of results

* Examples: Regional population growth of XXX **was** significantly **correlated** with three covariates with a five-year time lag. As air temperature and sea-ice cover in the winter foraging regions are themselves significantly correlated, the latter two associations may **reflect** a response to the same environmental process or linkage.

### Discussion: Mix of Tenses(Present tense HIGH, Past tense Mid)

* past and present, depending on what is being described

* description of own results: past tense

* facts or conclusions: present tense

* Example:Current advances in remote, large-scale observation of Southern Ocean higher-order predators **suggest** that spatially extensive monitoring of land-breeding predators will improve in the future.

## 3.6 Voice

Active and Passive Voice

* both used at varying degrees in all manuscript sections

* Examples

    * Active Voice: Most miRNAs **are** 22-nucleotide RNA molecules involved in regulation of gene expression.

    * Passive voice: Initially, miRNAs were thought to repress protein output with little influence on mRNA levels.

### Active and Passive Voice

* ignore your spell-checker(which is trained to indicate passive voices)

* key: use each in the appropriate sections of your manuscript

|    | Passive Voice   | Active Voice   | 
| :-----: | :-----: |:-----: |

## 3.7 Run-on Expressions

Run-on Expressions: etc.; and so on; and so forth;

* tend to be vague and imporecise

* reader needs to fill in the ... (blanks)

* more common in popular science essays

* Examples:

| informal        | formal    | 
| :----- | :----|
| This receptor family has protein X,Y,Z **and so on**. | This receptor family contains several members,**including** protein X,Y,Z.|
| These semiconductors are put into mobile phones, TVs, robots **etc**. | These semiconductors are used in mobile phones, TVs, robots **and other** electronic devices. |
| Micropumps can be used in drug delivery, lab-on-a-chip analysis, **and so forth** | Micropumps can be used in drup delivery, lab-on-a-chip analysis, **and similar** specialized applications requiring self-contained pumps. |
