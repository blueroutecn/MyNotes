# Flow

## 4.1 Overview

### Connecting Ideas --- Elements of Logic and Flow

* Flow is concerned with how thoughts move from on sentence/statement to the next.

* Establishing a **CLEAR** and **PRECISE** connection between ideas is crucial for clarity and logic of argument.

* several elements available to enhance and imporve the flow of thought.

* Essential to allow your readers to easily follow your line of thought.

    * **ALWAYS think of your Audience**

    * Use of informal linking language to be avoided


## 4.2 Linkers

| Function    | Subordinators(introduce a <br>dependent clause<br> that must be joind to<br> a complete sentence)    | Sentence Connectors<br>(introduce a<br> complete sentence<br> or independent clause) |Phrases Linkers(introduce a noun phrase)|
| :----- | :----| :----| :----|
| **Addition** |  |  furthermore<br>in addition<br> moreover| in addition to |
| **Adversativity** | though<br>even though<br>despite the fact | however<br>nevertheless | despite<br>in spite of |
| **Cause and Effect** | because<br>since | therefore<br>as a result<br>consequently<br>hence<br>thus| because of<br>dut to<br>as a result of |
| **Clarification** |  | in other words<br>that is<br> |  |
| **Contrast** | while<br>whereas | in contrast<br>however<br>on the other hand | unlike |
| **Illustration** |  | for example<br>for instance |  |
| **Intensification** |  | on the contrary<br>as a matter of fact |  |


### Problem 1: Use of 'On the contrary' vs. 'In contrast'

* Intensify: **On the contrary / quite the contrary**: used to add to a negative statement, to disagree with a negative statemetn by someone else, or to answer 'No' to a question.


* Examples:
    * Object A is black. In contrast, object B is white. 

        * TWO different objects are compared with each other.


    * Object A is not black. On the contrary, object A is white.
        * SAME object commented on.

### Problem 2: use of 'Meanwhile' in academic writing

* "meanwhile" is not used in originally agademic writing.

* **MEANWHILE(adverb)**

    * in the intervening period of time: Meanwhile, Julie has found herself another walking partner.

    * at the same time: steam for another five minutes; meanwhile, make a white sauce.

* Example

    * Introduction of highland rice can bring a dramatic imporvement to farmers food security.Meanwhile, land use intensification could lead to an imporvement in access to market.

        * use of meanwhile results in vague and imprecise statement.

        * In addition? Further more? In contrast? 

        * **avoid use in academic writing altoghther**


### Placing of 'While' in a sentence


* Example

    * **While** certain materials exhibit shape memory only when heated, other materials undergo a shape change both when heated and when cooled.

    * Certain materials exhibit shape memory only when heated, **while** other materials undergo a shape change both when heated and when cooled.

    * NO DIFFERENCE in meaning, but **if placed at the beginning, reader better prepared for contrasting statement.**


### Summary

* use linker phrases whenever they can imporve the flow of your story/argument.

* use of the most appropriate linker phrases to establish a clear and logical link between your statements.

* remember that the use of linking phrases differs somewhat between Chinese and English.

* learn how to correctly use these phrases by reading your papers with focus on linking expressions.


## 4.3 Punctuation

### full stops

Punctuation: full stops, comma, semicolon, colon

* do NOT break up your line of thought

* instead, they help your feader to breathe regularly

* they give you the opportunity to indroduce a sentence connector/linnk phrase

* they help you finish one thought before starting the next

* **use them generously**

### comma**,**

* used for **clauses**(The book, which is rare, connot be found in the library)

* used for **lists**(The FIFA president, the head of communications, the FIFA spokes person and the FIFA general secretary sit in a car.)

* often used with **subordinators**(Although...,...;If...,...;...,whereas...)

* danger of losing your line of argument when overused

* **use with caution**


### simicolon**;**

* join two completely independed sentences

* can be used with sentence connectors(; however, ; thus, ; for example,)

* used to break up loger sentences

* useful for separating long items in a list

* **only use them occasionally**


### colon**:**

* used to introduce a list

* **avoid overuse when formulating a clear scientific thought**

### Summary

* avoid writing long sentences - use full stops as much as you can
    * **greatly improves clarity**

* use comma only if necessary(<3 per sentence)
    * too many conna increases the chances of grammar mistakes

* use semicolons sparsely and replace with full stop if possible

### 4.4 Conjunctions

|**Conjunction**  |  **Connector**   | **subordinator** |
| :----- | :----| :----|
| and<br>but<br>or |  however<br>thus<br>also... | because<br>if<br>while... |
|  Use a comma | Use a semicolon or period |  Use a comma |
|  Birds fly, but fish swim | Birds fly; however, fish swim. | Birds fly, while fish swim.  | 



### Problem 1: Use of conjunctions at the beginning of a sentence

* Original Version
    
    * The poverty levels were found to be reduced. **Though** the unemployment levels remained high. **And** the illiteracy levels also. **BUT** no changes in income distribution were observed during the time of this study.

* Improved version
    
     * The poverty levels were found to be reduced, **even though** the unemployment levels remained high. **In addition**, the illiteracy levels were also found to be evaluated. **However**, no changes in income distribution were observed during the time of this study. 

* In a Nutshell

    * BUT: In contrast / However / Unexpectedly / Surprisingly

    * AND: In addition / Also / Furthermore / Importantly

    * THOUGH: Only use after comma as part of a clause(even though)

### Problem 2: Using of 'and' to connect unrelated facts

* Example

    * Insert A is involved in the formation of a long ordered loop structure, **and** the sequence of this insert is poorly conserved.

    * Insert A is involved in teh formation of a long ordered loop. Interestingly, the sequence of this insert is poorly conserved, suggesting that ...

### Summary

* use the most appropriate linker phrases to establish a logical link between your statements.

* do not use conjunctions to link two sentences.

* when reading academic papers, pay attention to how authors link ideas; thought and arguments.
