## 几个资源记录解释

### SOA


### MX

* Definition: MR records cause no additional section processing.  The main use for MR is as a forwarding entry for a user who has moved to a different mailbox.

* MX记录包含两部分

    * PREFERENCE: A 16 bit integer which specifies the preference given to this RR among others at the same owner.  Lower values are preferred.

    * EXCHANGE : A <domain-name> which specifies a host willing to act as a mail exchange for the owner name.



### TXT

* Definition: TXT RRs are used to hold descriptive text.  The semantics of the text depends on the domain where it is found.
